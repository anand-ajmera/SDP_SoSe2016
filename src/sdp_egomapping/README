I think this is what Fred want.
This egocentric map take the map data from the local_costmap_node.

I have modified the radius of the uncertainty around each measured laser point.
This data can be changed in the launch file using the line:
<param name="inflation_radius" type="double" value="0.1" />

The map setting can be changed using:
rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure

Some map setting are not dynamically editable, i.e: map size, obstacle detection range ...
thus the changes must be make in the configure file:
src/cob_robots/cob_hardware_config/cob3-1/config/local_costmap_params.yaml
